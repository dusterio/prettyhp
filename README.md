PrettyHP is an opinionated PHP code formatter

It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

PrettyHP will try to comply with PSR as much as possible.

Inspired by JavaScript's [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

## But why?

Your IDE or editor may already have some basic formatting built-in, but:

- At least PhpStorm cannot re-format code automatically before committing to VCS;
- Different team members may have different editors, views and standards;
- At least PhpStorm doesn't really enforce styling, it just does some basic indenting.

Why not use existing PHP code formatters?

### phpfmt

phpfmt is officially closed, the repo is deleted by the authors.

### php-cs-fixer

I'm a very experienced developer and Linux user, yet I couldn't get it up and running in 10+ minutes. Something is just wrong
about it. Since the tool's verbose mode is not implemented, I couldn't debug it any further.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require --dev dusterio/prettyhp
```

We recommend to add a pre-commit Git hook so that any modified PHP files are
prettified right before the commit:

```bash
$ cat .git/hooks/pre-commit

git diff --staged --diff-filter=dx --name-only HEAD | grep ".*\.php$" | xargs -I % sh -c 'vendor/bin/prettyhp  %; git add %'
```

## Manual usage

PrettyHP is meant for PSR 4 compliant files â€“ one file should contain one PHP class.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/prettyhp [filename]
```
