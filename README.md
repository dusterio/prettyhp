PrettyHP is an opinionated PHP code formatter

It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

PrettyHP will try to comply with PSR as much as possible.

Inspired by JavaScript's [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

## But why?

Your IDE or editor may already have some basic formatting built-in, but:

- At least PhpStorm cannot re-format code automatically before committing to VCS;
- Different team members may have different editors, views and standards;
- At least PhpStorm doesn't really enforce styling, it just does some basic indenting.

## Installation

```bash
$ composer require --dev dusterio/prettyhp
```

We recommend to add a pre-commit Git hook so that any modified PHP files are
prettified right before the commit:

```bash
$ cat .git/hooks/pre_commit
```

## Manual usage

PrettyHP is meant for PSR 4 compliant files â€“ one file should contain one PHP class.

```bash
$ vendor/bin/prettyhp [filename]
```
